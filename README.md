# BirthdApp

Heya! Another study case folks! My forst React repo actually. I'm pretty happy with the progress with the learning path until now, so exited to be familiar with the modern frontend development ecosystem. This will be a little practice to start with the React fundamentals: a TODO list on steroids. Here you'll be capable of enter a friend's born date and it'll bring you a countdown (in a days scale) to his/her next birthday. I'll be, also, trying Vite as development environment. I saw all the dependencies create-react-up comes with and didn't want to set that up if an alternative as Vite is at hand. I guess i'd give it a shot for the next project.

# What I'm learning here

- React fundamental concepts: elements, components, props and state.
- Development environments: Vite, create-react-app, differences, pros and cons.
- Software registries: NPM, it's CLI, libraries installation.
- Libraries usage: my first experience with libraries, using dates-fns to handle dates in Javascript.
- Alternative deployment service: Vercel.

# Dates-fns

Dates-fns (https://date-fns.org/) ended being such a nice tool to work with dates. I've strugled a bit working with de Date object, it's timezones and stuff. It's my first time working with dates and this library was awesome, so easy to install and use. I keep loving more and more functional programming as well!
